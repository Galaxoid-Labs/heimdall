# Heimdall — CLAUDE.md

> **Working name: `heimdall`.** Heimdall is the watchman who guards the Bifröst
> bridge — fitting for the thing that brokers every message between Odin and the
> web layer, and it ties cleanly to your existing **Bifrost** webview work. The
> name is a placeholder: to rename, find/replace `heimdall` / `Heimdall` /
> `hd` across the repo. (Alternates considered: Ratatoskr — but that's already a
> subsystem name inside Vör — Gjallarhorn, Bifrost-successor.)

A **lightweight Tauri**, in Odin. Users write their backend in Odin and their UI
in whatever web stack they like; Heimdall wires the two together, embeds the
frontend into a single native binary, and ships it. No Rust, no Cargo, no
`tauri.conf.json` sprawl, sub-second iteration.

This file is the project bible for Claude Code. Read it before touching anything.
Architecture-first: understand the three layers and the bridge contract before
writing a line. **The phased build plan, task checklists, and sequencing live in
`DEVELOPMENT.md`** — this file is the *what/why*, that one is the *how/when*.

---

## Status

**The MVP is built and working on macOS, Linux, and Windows.** Design informed by
**Wails v3** (we lifted its service model, event bus, binding-gen strategy, and
lifecycle hooks).

Done & verified (see `DECISIONS.md` for the full log, `docs/internals.md` for the
status table, headless self-tests under `examples/_probe*`):

- IPC bridge — services + `invoke` (JSON, compile-time-generated marshalling).
- Event bus — `emit` (Odin) / `on` (JS), thread-safe.
- Asset embed + serving — a real `app://` custom scheme on every backend
  (`WKURLSchemeHandler` / WebKitGTK URI scheme / WebView2 `WebResourceRequested`);
  the loopback `Asset_Server` remains as an unused fallback seam.
- Lifecycle hooks — `on_startup`, `on_shutdown`, `should_quit` (enforced natively).
- `heimdall` CLI — `new`, `dev`, `build`, `bundle`, `sign`, `embed`,
  `generate-bindings`, `doctor`, `docs`.
- Typed bindings — `generate-bindings` schema-dump → `.d.ts`.
- **Backend vtable** (`backend.odin`) — the seam every backend implements.
- **Native macOS WKWebView backend** (`backend_darwin.odin`, objc interop) — the
  macOS backend. Includes
  native menus (`menu.odin` + App_Config.menu).
- **Native Linux backend on GTK4 + libadwaita + webkitgtk-6.0**
  (`backend_linux.odin`, GObject/C interop) — the **default** on Linux. AdwHeaderBar
  title bar that follows the system light/dark theme (`adw_init`), custom `app://`
  scheme, `GtkPopoverMenuBar` menus, `should_quit` via `close-request`. All
  `_probe*` pass identically to macOS.
- **Native Windows backend on WebView2 / COM** (`backend_windows.odin`, hand-laid
  COM vtables) — the **default** on Windows. Custom `app://` scheme (via an
  implemented `ICoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions4`), `HMENU` menus + accelerators,
  `should_quit` via `WM_CLOSE`, and the modern Win11 title bar
  (`DwmSetWindowAttribute` — rounded corners + immersive dark mode following the
  system theme). The loader is vendored static (`heimdall/webview2/`, no DLL to
  ship). All `_probe*` pass identically to macOS/Linux.
- macOS `.app` bundling + code signing + notarization + a reusable CI action;
  Windows **Inno Setup installer** (`.exe`) + portable `.zip` + `signtool` signing
  (icon/version embedded via `rc.exe`, `-subsystem:windows`); Linux `.deb`/`.rpm`.
- Docs site (VitePress, `docs/`) + branding.

### ► PICK UP HERE — next

All three native backends are done (macOS/Linux/Windows) and are the *only*
backends — the vendored `webview/webview` bootstrap, the `HEIMDALL_WEBVIEW` define,
and the `--webview` flag have been removed (capstone complete). The framework is
pure Odin + each platform's system webview. Candidate next steps, none blocking:

- **macOS backend parity pass — DONE.** macOS now matches Linux/Windows:
  `resizable`/`fixed` is honored (Resizable style-mask bit at create +
  toggled in `dwn_set_size`); the WKWebView gets first-responder focus on
  show/focus (parity with Linux `grab_focus` / Windows `MoveFocus`); menu
  accelerators verified firing while the web content has focus (responder chain).
  All `_probe*` incl. `_probe_window`/`_probe_menu` pass.
- Tray (reuse `tray-odin`) + native dialogs across all three backends.
- `.dmg`, AppImage.
- **Deep-link follow-up:** Windows/Linux single-instance forwarding (the
  "already-running" case). macOS is complete; cold-start works on all three.
  Concrete per-platform steps are in the `TODO` block at the top of
  `heimdall/deeplink.odin` (Windows: mutex + `WM_COPYDATA`; Linux: GApplication
  open-forwarding or a lockfile+socket). Verify on a real installed build.

Done since:
- Typed **event** payloads — `event(app, name, T)` declares a payload type;
  `generate-bindings` emits a `HeimdallEvents` map + generic typed `on<K>`
  (commands were already typed). The built-in `menu` event is auto-declared.
- **Deep linking** (`myapp://`) — `App_Config.url_schemes` + `on_open_url` hook +
  typed `open-url` event; OS registration from `[bundle].schemes` (macOS
  CFBundleURLTypes / Linux .desktop MimeType / Windows registry). macOS delivery
  via `application:openURLs:` (cold-start + running); Windows/Linux cold-start via
  argv. Cold-start events queue until the frontend signals ready (`win.__ready`).

## Philosophy

- **Bring your own bundler.** We do not ship Node, npm, Vite, or a blessed
  framework. The user's frontend is a folder of static files (`dist/`). Whether
  that came from Vite, esbuild, SvelteKit's static adapter, or hand-written HTML
  is none of our business. This is the single most important scoping decision —
  it keeps Heimdall small and keeps us out of the JS toolchain treadmill.
- **The binary is the deliverable.** Frontend assets are embedded at compile time
  via `#load`. A shipped app is one executable with everything inside it. No
  sidecar `resources/` directory, no installer gymnastics.
- **The bridge is dumb on purpose.** Receive JSON, call an Odin proc, send JSON
  back. No async/await ceremony, no trait machinery. If you can describe it in
  one sentence, the implementation should be nearly that simple.
- **Honest about Odin.** Odin has no user-defined attributes with runtime
  reflection (no `@(my_custom_tag)` you can enumerate), and no proc-macros. So we
  do **not** fake Tauri's `#[command]` macro. Commands are registered with a
  parametric-polymorphic `command()` call that generates the JSON marshalling
  glue at compile time from the handler's own argument/return types. Type-safe,
  idiomatic, no magic the compiler will reject. Typed TS definitions come from a
  **schema-dump mode** that uses Odin's real RTTI (`core:reflect`) — see Binding
  Generation. This sidesteps the chicken-and-egg mess Wails v2 had.
- **Two directions, two mechanisms.** Request/response is `invoke` (JS asks Odin,
  awaits a result). Push is the **event bus** (`emit` from Odin, `on` in JS) for
  progress, background work, and state sync. Don't conflate them.
- **Fast inner loop.** `heimdall dev` should rebuild and relaunch in the time it
  takes Tauri to think about it. This is the main reason to do this in Odin.

Web never touches the OS directly. Everything privileged goes through a
registered command. That boundary is the whole security/architecture story.

## Architecture

### Native shell

A thin per-platform layer behind one Odin interface. The public surface the user
sees is platform-agnostic:

```odin
App        :: struct { /* opaque; holds webview, window, service registry, event bus, ... */ }
App_Config :: struct {
    title:        string,
    width, height:int,
    resizable:    bool,
    dev_url:      string,  // e.g. "http://localhost:5173" — used only in dev builds
    icon:         []u8,    // embedded PNG — macOS Dock + Windows title-bar/taskbar icon

    // Initial window state (optional; best-effort per platform — center/always_on_top
    // are no-ops under Wayland). min_width/min_height, maximized, fullscreen,
    // always_on_top, center, hidden.
    min_width, min_height: int,
    maximized, fullscreen, always_on_top, center, hidden: bool,

    // Lifecycle hooks (all optional; nil == skip)
    on_startup:   proc(app: ^App) -> Error, // after webview init, before frontend loads
    on_shutdown:  proc(app: ^App),          // on close; clean up here
    should_quit:  proc(app: ^App) -> bool,  // return false to veto a quit/close
}

create  :: proc(cfg: App_Config) -> (^App, Error)
run     :: proc(app: ^App)                  // blocks; runs the platform event loop
destroy :: proc(app: ^App)

// Unified window control — one API, platform switch under the backend vtable
// (Backend.window_op). Also exposed to JS via the built-in reserved `win` service
// (invoke("win.minimize") / generated `win.minimize()`).
window_minimize/maximize/unmaximize/show/hide/focus/center/close :: proc(app: ^App)
window_set_fullscreen :: proc(app: ^App, on: bool)
window_set_title :: proc(app: ^App, title: string)
window_set_size  :: proc(app: ^App, width, height: int)
```

Internally, dispatch on `ODIN_OS` with `when`:

```odin
when ODIN_OS == .Darwin  { /* WKWebView via objc interop */ }
when ODIN_OS == .Linux   { /* WebKitGTK via foreign import C */ }
when ODIN_OS == .Windows { /* WebView2 via COM vtables */ }
```

Keep each backend in its own file (`backend_darwin.odin`, `backend_linux.odin`,
`backend_windows.odin`) gated by build-tag/`when`, all implementing the same
small internal vtable: `webview_create`, `webview_navigate`, `webview_eval`,
`webview_set_title`, `webview_on_message`, `run_loop`, `dispatch_main`.

### Webview backends

| Platform | API        | Binding approach                                   | Difficulty |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Linux    | WebKitGTK  | `foreign import` against `webkitgtk-6.0` (GTK4) + `libadwaita-1`; plain C / GObject | easy       |
| macOS    | WKWebView  | Odin Objective-C interop (`@(objc_class)`, `objc_send`) — same machinery as the Metal vendor bindings | medium     |
| Windows  | WebView2   | COM: hand-lay vtable structs, call through fn-ptrs, **implement** the completion/event handler interfaces yourself (vtable + QueryInterface + refcount) | tedious    |

Message channel per platform (this is how JS→Odin works):

- **WebKit / WebKitGTK:** `window.webkit.messageHandlers.<name>.postMessage(...)`,
  received via a registered script message handler.
- **WebView2:** `window.chrome.webview.postMessage(...)`, received via
  `add_WebMessageReceived`.

Odin→JS is always "evaluate this JS string in the page": `evaluateJavaScript:` /
`webkit_web_view_evaluate_javascript` / `ExecuteScript`. The bridge uses that to
resolve the JS-side promise (see below).

> **Backends (history).** The project bootstrapped on the tiny `webview/webview` C
> library to get the request/response path, shim injection, and `dispatch_main`
> quickly, behind the internal `Backend` vtable. All three platforms now have
> hand-written native backends (WKWebView / WebKitGTK / WebView2), each with menus,
> a real `app://` scheme, and `should_quit` — so the `webview/webview` bootstrap
> has been removed entirely. The vtable seam remains; the native backend is the
> only implementation per platform.

### IPC bridge — services & commands

Commands are grouped under **services**: a named namespace backed by an Odin
struct that can hold state. This is lifted from Wails v3 and keeps real apps
organized — the service struct is a mini-backend, not just a static namespace.

**The contract.** A command is an Odin proc taking `(^Service, Args)` and
returning `(Result, Error)`, where `Args`/`Result` are JSON-marshalable Odin
types (or `()`):

```odin
import "core:encoding/json"

Greeting :: struct { prefix: string }                 // service state

Greet_Args   :: struct { name: string }
Greet_Result :: struct { message: string }

greet :: proc(s: ^Greeting, args: Greet_Args) -> (Greet_Result, Error) {
    return { message = fmt.tprintf("%s%s", s.prefix, args.name) }, nil
}
```

**Registration is parametric** — `command` is polymorphic over the service and
the handler's own arg/result types, so it generates the unmarshal/marshal glue at
compile time with no custom-attribute reflection:

```odin
service :: proc(app: ^App, name: string, state: ^$S) -> Service_Handle
command :: proc(svc: Service_Handle, name: string,
                handler: proc(s: ^$S, args: $A) -> ($R, Error))
```

Internally each command is a type-erased thunk keyed by `"service.command"`:
`raw_json -> json.unmarshal(into A) -> handler(state, A) -> json.marshal(R) -> raw_json`,
stored in the app's registry (`map[string]Thunk`).

Wiring an app:

```odin
main :: proc() {
    app, err := heimdall.create({
        title = "Demo", width = 900, height = 600,
        on_startup = on_startup, on_shutdown = on_shutdown,
    })
    if err != nil { /* ... */ }
    defer heimdall.destroy(app)

    greeting := Greeting{ prefix = "Hello, " }
    files    := File_Service{}

    g := heimdall.service(app, "greeting", &greeting)
    heimdall.command(g, "greet", greet)

    f := heimdall.service(app, "files", &files)
    heimdall.command(f, "read_file", read_file)

    heimdall.run(app)
}
```

**JS side** is a small shim injected before the page loads, exposed as
`window.__HEIMDALL__` with `invoke` (request/response) and `on` (events):

```js
const msg = await invoke("greeting.greet", { name: "Jake" });
// invoke("service.command", args) -> Promise:
//   generate an id, stash {resolve,reject} in a pending map,
//   postMessage({ id, name, args }),
//   Odin runs the command, then eval()s:
//     window.__HEIMDALL__._resolve(id, result)  // or _reject(id, errStr)
```

So the round trip is: `invoke` → postMessage → Odin dispatch → handler →
`eval("__HEIMDALL__._resolve(id, …)")` → promise resolves. One pending-map, one
id counter. That's the entire request/response path.

**Dev vs prod URL.** In a dev build the webview points at `dev_url`
(`http://localhost:5173`) so the user gets their bundler's HMR. In a release
build it points at `app://localhost/index.html` served from embedded assets. This
mirrors Tauri exactly and is the key DX win. Switch via build flag
(`-define:HEIMDALL_DEV=true`) or config.

### Threading

Webview callbacks fire on the **UI thread**, and `eval` must run there too. Any
command that does real work off-thread must marshal its result back before
touching the webview:

```odin
dispatch_main :: proc(app: ^App, fn: proc(app: ^App, user: rawptr), user: rawptr)
```

Backends implement this with the platform's main-thread dispatch
(`dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue())` on macOS, `g_idle_add` on GTK,
`PostMessage` to the UI window on Windows). The rule for handlers: **never call
`eval`/resolve from a worker thread — always hop through `dispatch_main` first.**
Document this loudly; it's the easiest thing to get subtly wrong.

### Events (pub/sub)

`invoke` is request/response. The **event bus** is the push direction — Odin
emitting to JS without being asked. Use for progress, background-task completion,
multi-window state sync. (Wails has this; our original design didn't — it's a
real gap to close.)

```odin
// Odin: emit with any JSON-marshalable payload
Progress :: struct { read, total: int }
heimdall.emit(app, "file.progress", Progress{ read = 512, total = 1000 })
```

```js
// JS: subscribe; returns an unsubscribe fn
const off = on("file.progress", (p) => updateBar(p.read, p.total));
// later: off()
```

**Implementation.** `emit` marshals the payload and pushes `{name, payload}` onto
an event queue. The UI-thread loop drains it and `eval`s
`__HEIMDALL__._event(name, payload)`, which fans out to registered `on` handlers.
Same UI-thread rule as the bridge: emitting from a worker thread must hop through
`dispatch_main`. Events are fire-and-forget — no ack, no return value. (Later: a
typed event registry so emitted payload types land in the generated `.d.ts`.)

### Binding generation (typed JS) — decided

The goal: typed `invoke`/`on` on the JS side via generated `.d.ts`, **without**
forcing it (untyped `invoke` must keep working).

Wails v2 did this with a runtime-reflection hack: build with a special flag, run
the binary so reflection could discover bindings, then generate — a chicken-and-egg
where you couldn't build without bindings or generate them without building. v3
moved to a static source analyzer. We take the cleaner-for-Odin middle path:

**`heimdall generate-bindings` runs the app in schema-dump mode.** A
`-define:HEIMDALL_SCHEMA=true` build, on `run`, instead of opening a window:

1. initializes services (so the registry is populated),
2. walks the registry; for each command, reads the `Args`/`Result` **typeids**
   captured at registration and introspects them via `core:reflect`
   (`struct_field_names` / `struct_field_types` / `struct_field_tags`),
3. emits a JSON schema of services → commands → field types,
4. the CLI turns that schema into `.d.ts`,
5. exits.

Why this works in Odin where the Wails v2 approach was painful: Odin has real RTTI
(`core:reflect`, `type_info_of`), the same machinery `core:encoding/json` already
uses to marshal — so the types we serialize and the types we document come from
one source of truth. And there's no chicken-and-egg here: untyped `invoke` works
the moment a command is registered; the `.d.ts` is purely additive.

> Alternative considered: static-parse the source with `core:odin/parser` (like
> Wails v3). Rejected for MVP — heavier to vendor than reusing the RTTI we already
> have at registration time.

### Asset embedding + `app://` scheme

Production assets are baked in. The CLI's `embed` step turns a `dist/` tree into
a generated Odin file:

```odin
// generated: assets_gen.odin
ASSETS := map[string]Asset {
    "index.html"      = { data = #load("dist/index.html"),     mime = "text/html" },
    "assets/app.js"   = { data = #load("dist/assets/app.js"),  mime = "text/javascript" },
    // ...
}
```

The scheme handler resolves `app://localhost/<path>` against `ASSETS`, returning
bytes + MIME. Serving from a custom scheme (not `file://`) sidesteps CORS/origin
headaches and gives a stable origin for `fetch`. Each backend registers it:
`WKURLSchemeHandler` / `webkit_web_context_register_uri_scheme` /
`AddWebResourceRequestedFilter` + `WebResourceRequested`.

### Window, menus, tray, dialogs

Thin native wrappers, all optional:

- **Menus:** `NSMenu` (macOS) / GTK menu / Win32 menus.
- **Tray:** reuse **tray-odin** (already cross-platform: macOS/Windows/Linux).
- **Dialogs:** native file open/save + message boxes per platform.

Keep these as separate, importable modules so a minimal app pays for none of them.

## The `heimdall` CLI

A single Odin binary. This is the user's primary touchpoint — make it pleasant.

| Command                         | What it does                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `heimdall new <name>`           | Scaffold a project (`--frontend vanilla\|sveltekit`, `--pm bun\|npm\|pnpm\|yarn\|deno`). Wires the bridge, JS client + typed bindings, example command, vendored framework, CI. |
| `heimdall dev`                  | Start the frontend dev server (configurable cmd, default `bun run dev`), build the Odin app with `HEIMDALL_DEV=true`, launch pointing at the dev URL. Rebuild + relaunch Odin on change. |
| `heimdall build`                | Run the frontend build (`npm run build`), `embed` the output, compile Odin `-o:speed`, emit the final binary. Package with `heimdall bundle`. |
| `heimdall embed <dir> <out>`    | Standalone asset-embed step → generated `.odin`. Composable; `build` calls it. |
| `heimdall generate-bindings`    | Run the app in schema-dump mode (`core:reflect` over the service registry) and emit `.d.ts` for typed `invoke`/`on`. Optional — untyped `invoke` works without it. |
| `heimdall bundle`               | Platform packaging: macOS `.app` (sign/notarize), Linux `.deb` + `.rpm`, and Windows Inno Setup installer `.exe` + portable `.zip` (signtool). |
| `heimdall doctor`               | Check toolchain: `odin` present, `node`/bundler present, platform webview deps (WebKitGTK headers, WebView2 runtime, Xcode CLT). Print actionable fixes. |

`new` flow target: **clone template → `cd` → `npm install` → `heimdall dev` →
window opens with a working `invoke` round-trip, in under a couple minutes.**

  main.odin                 # package main;  import hd "heimdall"
  services.odin             # package main — user's service structs + command procs

The user's Odin is the **root package** (no `src/` folder — in Odin the directory
name is the import name, so `src` is a bad package name). The framework is vendored
as the `./heimdall/` subdirectory and imported with `import hd "heimdall"` — no
collection flag, no `..`. (Larger apps can move the backend into a named folder and
use a `-collection` instead; the CLI injects the flag. Default template stays
collection-free.) Note: `web/src/` above is the *frontend's* source — that's the JS
bundler's convention, not an Odin package.

Keep `heimdall.toml` tiny — title, window size, icon path, `dev_cmd`,
`build_cmd`, `dist_dir`. Resist the urge to grow a config zoo.

## Build & toolchain

```
odin build cli -out:heimdall-cli -o:speed    # build the CLI (root `heimdall/` is the framework pkg)
odin run examples/hello                        # run an example directly
odin test heimdall                             # library tests
```

User app, under the hood of `heimdall build`:

```
(cd web && npm run build)                      # → web/dist
heimdall embed web/dist ./assets_gen.odin
odin build . -out:myapp -o:speed               # root package
```

Platform link deps (document in `doctor`):

- **Linux:** GTK4 + libadwaita + the GTK4 WebKit port — `webkitgtk-6.0`,
  `libadwaita-1`, `gtk4` dev packages.
- **macOS:** link `WebKit`, `Cocoa` frameworks; Xcode command-line tools.
- **Windows:** WebView2 loader (`WebView2Loader.dll`) + runtime; the Evergreen
  runtime ships on current Windows but verify in `doctor`.

## Odin conventions

- **`core:os` is the redesigned package** (dev-2026-03+): allocating procs take an
  explicit allocator (`os.read_entire_file(path, context.allocator)`), file
  handles are `^os.File`, errors are the `os.Error` union — check `err != nil`,
  not `ERROR_NONE`. Don't write against the old `core:os/old` API.
- **Errors:** a single `Error` union of enums for the library
  (`Bridge_Error`, `Webview_Error`, `Io_Error`, …). Propagate with `or_return`.
  Commands return `(Result, Error)`; `nil` Error == success.
- **No methods.** Procedures over data: `webview_navigate(wv, url)`, not
  `wv.navigate(url)`. Constructors are `create`/`init`, teardown `destroy`.
- **Foreign bindings** live in their backend file behind `when ODIN_OS == …`.
  C bindings via `foreign import` + `@(link_name=...)`; macOS via the objc
  interop attributes; never leak platform types into the public API.
- **Allocators:** the bridge hot path should avoid per-call heap churn where
  possible — prefer `context.temp_allocator` for transient JSON buffers and free
  per frame/message. Ship a tracking-allocator path in debug to catch leaks.
- **`@(require_results)`** on anything returning an Error or a handle.

## Roadmap / explicitly out of scope (for now)

In scope, later:

- Windows/WebView2 backend (after macOS+Linux).
- Typed **event** payloads in the generated `.d.ts` (commands are covered in MVP;
  events get typed signatures in a second pass).
- `bundle`: Windows `.exe` packaging (macOS `.app` + Linux `.deb`/`.rpm` done);
  AppImage; icons; more code-signing hooks.
- Auto-updater, multi-window, plugin registry.

(Services, the event bus, lifecycle hooks, and `generate-bindings` for commands
are **MVP**, not deferred — see Status.)

Out of scope (by design — keeps us lightweight):

- Shipping a bundled Node/npm or a mandated frontend framework.
- A `tauri.conf.json`-style mega-config.
- A native plugin marketplace. People can fork and extend.

## Decisions (from the Wails review) & remaining open questions

Decided:

1. **Services + invoke namespacing** — commands live under named, stateful
   services; JS calls `invoke("service.command", args)`. ✅
2. **Event bus** — `emit` (Odin) / `on` (JS), fire-and-forget, separate from
   `invoke`. ✅
3. **Binding generation** — schema-dump mode via `core:reflect`, optional, additive
   to untyped `invoke`. ✅
4. **Lifecycle hooks** — `on_startup` / `on_shutdown` / `should_quit` on
   `App_Config`. ✅

Still open:

5. **Relationship to Bifrost:** clean rewrite, or vendor Bifrost's existing
   backend abstraction when we reach the native-backend phase?
6. **Template frontends in `new`:** proposed vanilla (dependency-free, so
   `doctor`/`dev` works with zero npm) + one Svelte + one React. Confirm the set.
7. **Typed events:** ship typed event payloads in `.d.ts` for v1, or commands-only
   first and events in a second pass?

(Backends: all three platforms are native-only — the `webview/webview` bootstrap
has been removed. See DEVELOPMENT.md for the history.)
